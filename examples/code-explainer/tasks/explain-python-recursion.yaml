  Test explaining a recursive factorial function in Python.
  The skill should identify the recursive pattern and base case.

  prompt: "Explain this code to me"
  context:
    language: python
    complexity: beginner
    concept: recursion

expected:
  # Keywords that should appear in a good explanation
  output_contains:
    - "recursive"
    - "factorial"
  # Alternative keywords (any of these is acceptable)
  output_contains_any:
    - "base case"
    - "n <= 1"
    - "termination"
  outcomes:

graders:
  - name: explains_recursion
    type: code
    config:
      assertions:
        - "len(output) > 10"
      # For real testing, use stricter assertions:
      # - "'recurs' in output.lower()"
      # - "'base case' in output.lower() or 'n <= 1' in output"
